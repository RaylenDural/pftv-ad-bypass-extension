## Description

Project Free TV is a great site that hosts links to streams of movies and TV shows. However, it recently (March 2015) started showing an ad page on every link that the user can't skip for at least 10 seconds before being able to continue to the video.  I was not happy with having to wait 10 seconds for every link that I clicked, so I built this extension to redirect to the video from the ad page automatically without waiting 10 seconds.

It's a very simple extension, there isn't much to it - that's all it does.

All you have to do if download the extension, and the next time you go to Project Free TV, any link that you click on will automatically skip the ad.

## My other extensions

[Google Slides Auto Resize Speaker Notes](https://github.com/daattali/gslides-betternotes-extension) - the slides thumbnails in the Speaker Notes window of Google Slides are tiny. This extension dynamically resizes the slides to be more readable based on the window size.

[GitHub Diff Navigator](https://github.com/daattali/github-diff-navigator-extension) - Chrome extension that allows you to easily navigate through the changes in a file that has been edited on GitHub.

[Smileyfy My Facebook](https://github.com/daattali/smileyfy-my-facebook-extension) - Chrome extension that adds infinite happiness to your Facebook browsing, plus a little bonus rickrolling :)
